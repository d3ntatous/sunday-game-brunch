# Sunday Game Brunch
A wiki using jekyll, prose, and gh-pages for our brunch adventure.

For all of y'all collaborators, players, and fellow brunch eaters here is how we'll keep this thing up to date.
  1. You are now added as a collaborator for this here git repository.
  2. You feel that you have something to add to the wiki, probably something super important and/or easily forgotten.
  3. You then head over to [prose.io](http://prose.io) and authenticate/give access to your github account.
  4. You will somewhere here find a project folder with the name 'sunday-game-brunch'.
  5. You go into said project folder.
  6. You will be 'attacked' by a folder called 'character' and some general .md files (like '2016-08-09-alignment-guides.md').
  ..6a. If you want to create a post about a character (NPC or player) go into the 'character' folder and click 'New file'.
  ..6b. If you want to post about something a bit more general, like the specs for that 'Bag o' holding' you found last time just click 'New file'.
  7. When you post something don't forget to check the metadata tag (underneath 'preview', and above 'settings') because if you're in the character folder you can insert name, race, etc. And in the general one there are other options you're free to use. But always remember to pick a ***'Category'*** no matter what you do because otherwise it won't render properly in the wiki.
  8. Save/Commit you're additions/changes and celebrate with a ***highfive***
  

That's it! Should anything be unclear, not work as planned, or you want to be added as a collaborator give me a shout. Hugs <3
