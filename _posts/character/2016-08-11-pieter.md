Once upon a time, when magic was born, high concentrations of magical essence came to rest where the worlds laylines intertwine. The great temple of Mordinsaman, the ever-lasting forest of Everwood, and the cute bakery of Auntie Agda.

It is here, by chance, Pieter was born. Filled to the brim with potential and freshly picked blueberries.
