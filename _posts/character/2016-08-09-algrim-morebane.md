It was the day of my 50th birthday and I had been told by the elders that I was finally going to leave the temple of Berronar Truesilver. It was there I ever since I grew my first beard had lived and learned all that I know today. 
Most of my fellow scholars had long ago left on adventures but I found assurance and joy in the great stone halls. Also I was never able to finish that damn final test to earn the symbol of Berronar and become true Faenor to the Mother of Safety. 
But now I was leaving and told of an ancient relic that had been lost for eons and that it was now my destiny to find it.  They quickly put the holy symbol on my robe, packed my bag, drew me a map and sent me on my way. "Remember what we taught you!" The Priests shouted whilst I made my way down the road. 
"Finally!" I thought to myself. "My real adventure begins today!” 

But back at the temple the priests muttered between themselves: - "Do you think he suspects anything?" - "No. He's to stupid. I'm just glad we got rid of him.” – “Yes. He's to old to still be here. Now he will have to make his destiny his own".
