I grew up without ever feeling any parental love, I took care of that... permanetly. I was raised in a monastery, all the way up in the north. Grew big, strong, tought and without a sence of humor, only death. At nights I was escaping the monastery grounds, running as fast as the winds, to visit the local brewery. Always ready for a fight, and prepared to return home with bloody fists. Many years have past, since I won the cage. It's the only thing of value I ever had. Now everything is clear, the monastery is holding me back, like that cage, its time to roam the lands.
