Born in the High Roost at the peak of the highest mountain in Faerun. A child of the chieftain and the shaman of the tribe he was branded and cast out because a union between the two powers of the peak was forbidden since H'Arax the Demon reign many generations back.

Just a little chick without a name he was pummeled by the unrelenting forces of nature. The wind tore at his soft feathers, and the snow chilled his tiny body to the core. As light started leaving his body a shadow came over him and he passed out. By happenchance or maybe faith he was found by a group of monks on a pilgrimage that took him in. He took the name K'Raxas, meaning cursed in his mothertongue, and the monks as his tutors.

K'Raxas grew strong in spite of his harsh birth, or maybe because of it, and chose to dedicate his life to the protection of the unfortunate. No one should be born into the world as he did.
