When creating your character you can be any race (human, elf, dwarf, halfling, gnome, half-orc, half-elf, dragonborn, tiefling) and any class from the Players Handbook. The starting stats will be a standard point buy, use the app. So the highest possible starting stat is 15 before racial bonuses.

Choose a background from the Players Handbook, and I would like you to use these backgrounds as a framework for writing down your characters own story. If you can't find a background that you like modify one, or create a new one that feels great to you. I can then help you decide which proficiency bonuses and such your character should have üòÑ

Fill in the things that won't change during the game (class, background, race, etc) and leave the rest blank (ability scores, hp, equipment, etc) to be filled in with a real life pen.
